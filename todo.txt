- Start with building out a home component. I do not believe this project needs routes at this time.
- Decide on some different utility functions that will be needed by the app to handle
    - Card api calls.
        - create deck
        - draw from deck
        - shuffle deck
        
    - what does the expected return data from the api look like?
        - review docs and create appropriate types to store the expected payload data.
    - what to do with cards after calls.
    - managing players following card calls.

- I think utility functions and game logic should have a seperation of code location
- utils and context should talk to the game logic module that will contain the file(s) for game logic.
- utils will hold logic for communicating with card api
- One context will hold global state data for the card piles aka players and their bets/money
    - another context will hold main deck state information
